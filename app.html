                            Our solution is to use a technology that can be added to something a 
                            lot of us already have - a refrigerator.
                            <br><br>
                            To use fomoFOOD, you’ll need to buy our fridge sensor. Our fridge sensor 
                            is easy to install, and fits all refrigerators. All you need to do to get started, 
                            is to put a sensor on the inside fridge edge, install the app and connect it to your 
                            sensor.
                            <br><br>
                            How does it work?
                            <br>
                            Every time you open the door to your refrigerator, the sensor kicks in. It scans 
                            the items you’re putting in or taking out, noting the barcode and the expiration date. 
                            The information is sent to your phone, and you can see on the app what is inside your 
                            refrigerator and when it expires. If you take something out, the app will register the 
                            item as used up unless you put it back in.
                        </p>

                            Saving the world is not always easy, but with our app we hope to make it a little bit 
                            easier for you. With this app, our goal is that you will never get rotten or mouldy 
                            food in your fridge that must be thrown away.
                            <br><br> 
                            Based on your personal, and genius fridge sensor, the app will let you know when your 
                            fresh ingredients are getting close to their due date. Then it will suggest recipes 
                            where you can make use of your leftover ingredients.
                            <br><br> 
                            To make a more tailored experience, the app will also know what suggestions you like, 
                            and don't like. Do you have any special preferences, like allergies? No problem! 
                            You may always customize with your suggestion-settings. In this way you will get 
                            suggestions that are more relevant to you, the more you use the app!

                            We all know that it’s very easy to just throw your leftover food in the trash when 
                            you’re going away, especially if you know that it’ll expire by the time you come back 
                            home. Therefore, we wanted to add an option to give away your food so that it can be 
                            of use to someone else, and so that no perfectly good food goes to waste. 
                            <br><br>
                            We also realize that not everyone would want to just give away the food that they 
                            bought with their own, hard-earned money, which is why we added the “points”. When 
                            you give away food, you get a certain amount of points that you can later use, in the 
                            form of a discount to use the next time you buy food. We believe that a rewarding 
                            system will encourage people to want to use this function.
