                        <strong>Saving the world</strong> is not always easy, but with our app we hope to make it a
                        little bit
                        easier for you. With this app, our goal is that you will never get rotten or mouldy
                        food in your fridge that must be thrown away.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>Based on your personal</strong>, and genius fridge sensor, the app will let you know
                        when your
                        fresh ingredients are getting close to their due date. Then it will suggest recipes
                        where you can make use of your leftover ingredients.
                        <br><br>
                        <strong>To make a more tailored experience</strong>, the app will also know what suggestions you
                        like,
                        and don't like. Do you have any special preferences, like allergies? No problem!
                        You may always customize with your suggestion-settings. In this way you will get
                        suggestions that are more relevant to you, the more you use the app!

                        Our solution is to use a technology that can be added to something a
                        lot of us already have - a refrigerator.
                        <br><br>
                        To use fomoFOOD, you’ll need our smart fridge sensor. The fridge sensor
                        is easy to install, and fits all refrigerators. All you need to get started,
                        is to put the sensor on the inside of the fridge edge, install the app and connect it to your
                        sensor.
                        <br><br>
                        How does it work?
                        <br>
                        Every time you open the door to your refrigerator, the sensor kicks in. It scans
                        the items you’re putting in or taking out, noting the barcode and the expiration date.
                        The information is sent to your phone, and you can see on the app what is inside your
                        refrigerator and when it expires. If you take something out, the app will register the
                        item as used until you put it back in.

                        We all know that it’s very easy to just throw your leftover food in the trash when
                        you’re going away, especially if you know that it’ll expire by the time you come back
                        home. Therefore, we wanted to add an option to give away your food so that it can be
                        of use to someone else, and so that no perfectly good food goes to waste.
                        <br><br>
                        We also realize that not everyone would want to just give away the food that they
                        bought with their own, hard-earned money, which is why we added the “points”. When
                        you give away food, you get a certain amount of points that you can later use, in the
                        form of a discount to use the next time you buy food. We believe that a rewarding
                        system will encourage people to want to use this function.
