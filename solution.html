                            Global warming and climate change are a huge challenge, and the world needs to take action 
                            for the sake of our future. <a href="https://www.worldwildlife.org/initiatives/food-waste" title="Visit source" target="_blank" rel="author">Each year we throw food that could feed the population of USA times 10</a>, 
                            and we want to do something about that.<br><br>

                            To reach the UN-goals, reducing food waste is one of the most effective actions. According to 
                            <a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/reduced-food-waste" title="Visit source" target="_blank" rel="author">Project Drawdown</a> we can reduce emissions with 87 gigatons of carbon dioxide if 50% of food waste 
                            is reduced by 2050.<br><br> 

                            The food industries have a responsibility to change their business model to be able to adjust 
                            the way they produce their food. There are many ways they can help reduce the food that is not 
                            reaching the consumer. <a href="https://drawdown.org/solutions/reduced-food-waste" title="Visit source" target="_blank" rel="author"> A lot of food is being wasted in transportation and production.</a> 
                            On the other hand, the food production is affected by our consumer behavior, when we buy more, 
                            they produce more. We as consumers also have a responsibility to show the food industry that 
                            we want change, and we NEED a change. <br><br> 

                            We (fomoFOOD) believe that through action, influence and technology, it is possible to change 
                            the way we make our daily choices. Our goal is to make it easy for everyone to make the most out 
                            of the food they already have. Our app will motivate and simplify the food choices you make, 
                            and the sensor will make it impossible for you to forget food that is soon expiring.
